# Ynsta

It's a ruby app that was inspired by Instagram.
You can upload your own photos, and search them using tags, user name, etc.

Use ```bundle install``` and ```rails server```.
Then on your browser: http://localhost:3000/

To run unit tests, use ```spring rails test```.

That app was also deployed on Heroku https://ynsta.herokuapp.com (but not the latest revision).
